# ECE335-Integrated-Software-Systems

#####HW03
This assignment required us to write a program that generates a source array of random integers, and then count the numbers that fall in the range of 0-199, 200-399, 400-599, 600-799, 800-999 using both a switch statement and a sequence of if-then-else statements. This program also records how much time it takes to generate a count for all of the numbers with both approaches (for performance comparison purposes).

#####HW04
Two matrix copy routines were implemented in this program, and used to copy a source array populated with random integers. The execution times of both routines were recorded and compared to reveal the impact on code performance when taking advantage of locality.

#####HW05
This program implements three routines that calculate the running multiplication of values in an array and store the result in a destination array. Each routine demonstrates a different form of code optimization, through the use of separate accumulators, loop unrolling, and reassociation.
